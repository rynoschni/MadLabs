## A MadLAB, if you will...

We began with our starter code [https://github.com/seanrreid/DOM-Starter-Code](https://github.com/seanrreid/DOM-Starter-Code) that replaced items one at a time. One button click would replace one entry.

However, this isn't terribly efficient. It would be _much_ easier to collect a series of nouns, verbs, etc... and replace them all, in order, with a single click.

### Here's what we need to do this:

- We need to select a **group** of placeholder elements, not just a single element (dare we say, an _array_??)
- We need an array of words to replace the placeholders
- We need a button to trigger the replacement when clicked

### Here's how we're going to break it down:

1. Select all inputs _and_ our placeholders using the method `querySelectorAll()`
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll 
   - **HINT:** Using classes will help here
1. Use a `forEach` loop to create an array of values for our replacement words
1. Use a `forEach` loop to update the `innerHTML` of each placeholder
   - **HINT:** You'll want to use the same `index` to update each entry in the _placeholder_ array with the corresponding _input value_ (aka `input.value`). The `forEach()` method takes `index` as an agrgument, which will return the index of a given item in the loop. 
   
#### BONUS

* The `querySelectorAll()` method returns a `NodeList`, which is _like_ an array, but technically is **not** an array. It has its own `forEach()` method, that behaves like the `Array.prototype.forEach()` method. <br/>(Don't worry too much about prototypes yet...we'll get to them)
* **YOUR CHALLENGE**: Convert the `NodeList` to a proper array. You can use `Array.isArray(value)` method to test if the result is an array (it returns a boolean).

#### DOUBLE BONUS

* Once you have an array, use the `map()` method in place of the `forEach()`. <br/>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
